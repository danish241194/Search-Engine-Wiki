in the american south plantations but the new owners decided to subdivide them in order to make more living space available for the growing population in bertrand gravier helped enlarge the faubourg by including phillipa st which is now referred to as poydras street years later gravier died and jean gravier his brother was appointed to be the new owner of this estate land estate he continued in his brother’s footsteps by further extending the faubourg to circus street which is currently known as rampart street as jean gravier continued to expand the faubourg he allotted land near poydras street approximately feet in width for a canal this canal linked with an agency in bayou st john and flowed into an area called hagan avenue the region which was the canal is now jefferson davis parkway in addition gravier designated a tract for a turning basin which linked to canal street new orleans canal street at that time the basin was an uninhabited district of land which was allocated for the community unsurprisingly he later called the basin “place gravier ” gravier didn’t realize that the canal and “place gravier” would become the basis of dissension between the city of new orleans and the new orleans and carrollton railroad at this time the railroad company possessed the canal the basin and asserted ownership of segments of “place gravier ” the dispute between new orleans and the railroad concluded when the supreme court supreme court of the territory of orleans announced a judgment in support of jean gravier on may the supreme court of louisiana pronounced that the canal and basin were property of the railroad company however years later in the supreme court altered their judgment and decided that the “place gravier” would be owned by new orleans and as a location for the general public this explains why in the city of new orleans took legal action against philip werlein for possession of this basin the location was declared to be public property as had been stated in the judgment of new orleans won the lawsuit against werlein and the supreme court of louisiana when the displeased werlein decided that this verdict wasn’t fair he appealed the finding to the supreme court of the united states and they rendered a judgment in support of him the u s supreme court reasoned that new orleans had lost ownership of “place gravier ” so philip werlein was able to obtain possession of the disputed property and this site is now occupied by the infamous hotel de soto lafayette is distinctive in its perimeters because of its unique history

important to the city because there were many citizens that lived in this housing development and when it was torn down after hurricane katrina many residents lost their homes and had to turn to the new orleans mission homeless shelter this development housed only white residents until the s due to segregation laws and after the desegregation of the housing project it became one of the country’s most dangerous housing projects st thomas development st thomas projects had become predominately african american by the end of the s and remained that way until it had been torn down the city of new orleans was given a grant to demolish the site and rebuild along with this grant was funding to help over families to relocate to different areas during this time period the idea of this was to create a mixed income neighborhood so the crime rate would decrease as time progressed there was rental property built on the property other notable and recent developments include the new orleans jazz museum taking residence on oretha castle haley blvd the neighborhood’s most notable and main strip the new orleans jazz market which is the home of the new jazz orchestra will be moved to the vacant gator’s department store spot this new and improved space will include jazz archives and a “walk of fame ” also due to recent updates on the neighborhood website the citizens are attempting to

charge of making sure that there are no poisonous weeds or other plant life to the neighborhood in addition they are in charge of beautifying a specific part of the neighborhood whether that means to plant trees or pick up garbage off the streets there is also a publication of a monthly newsletter telling of the upcoming events for any specific month this is especially helpful for freshman seminar classes that are looking for a community service project or a community service project in general developments along o c haley include the new arrival of the sofab museum also known as the southern food and beverage museum the museum will be settled in the building that used to be the dryades market this museum will include culinary culture and history also in this museum there will be the

more information about the building and planning of the southern food and beverage museum will be published on facebook and twitter these recent developments have really altered the way the
